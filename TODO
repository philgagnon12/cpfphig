Findcmocka needs fix like melphig Findlua

CMakeLists.txt removed linking with Patcch, for mingw, gotta condition it if required by visual studio

src/CMakeLists.txt
- Try support at least windows 7 and above
   # TELLS it to compile for windows 10
    target_compile_definitions( ${CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME} PUBLIC _WIN32_WINNT=0x0A00 )

Removed a bunch of #include <Libloaderapi.h> .. to be able to compile under mingw, might need those back for visual studio
