1 replace CPFPHIG_CONST_CPFPHIG for CPFPHIG_CONST

2 unit test list_empty, unshift , list_previous

3. src/CMakeLists.txt
- Try support at least windows 7 and above
   # TELLS it to compile for windows 10
    target_compile_definitions( ${CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME} PUBLIC _WIN32_WINNT=0x0A00 )

4 Rework cpfphig_assert kind of like cpfphig_error_message

5. usleep deprecated , use nanosleep, nix/thread_cond_timed_wait sgot milliseconds conversion

6. implementers should either buffer stderr 
    setvbuf( stderr, stderr_buffer, _IOFBF, CPFPHIG_STDERR_BUFFER_SIZE )
    or redirect to a file
    freopen("ERROR.log", "w", stderr );

    i could also put in a error_type ( allocated message type ) 
    would fix being able to "get" message from an error struct

7. the error structs dont contain "error_message" ... "message" being the important bit

8. currently fdopen STDERR_FILENO for error_message_fprintf, make sure it works on all platform

9. add an error type "stacking" multiple errors within one, for multithreaded, specifically publisher_publish... when it receives an error, it overwrittes ... it would need to stack em
